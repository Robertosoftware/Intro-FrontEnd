# Given an array arr[] of integers and another integer target. Determine if there exist two distinct indices such that the sum of their elements is equal to the target.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], target = -2
# Output: true
# Explanation: arr[3] + arr[4] = -3 + 1 = -2
# Input: arr[] = [1, -2, 1, 0, 5], target = 0
# Output: false
# Explanation: None of the pair makes a sum of 0
# Input: arr[] = [11], target = 11
# Output: false
# Explanation: No pair is possible as only one element is present in arr[]
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 105
# -105 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
# -2*105 ≤ target ≤ 2*105
#thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
#print(thisset)

#use a set when you only care about existence, a dict (hashmap) when you care about who or where. (memory problem)
